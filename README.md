# IBM Statistics for Data Science with Python

This Statistics for Data Science course is designed to introduce you to the basic principles of statistical methods and procedures used for data analysis. After completing this course you will have practical knowledge of crucial topics in statistics including  - data gathering, summarizing data using descriptive statistics, displaying and visualizing data, examining relationships between variables, probability distributions, expected values, hypothesis testing, introduction to ANOVA (analysis of variance), regression and correlation analysis. You will take a hands-on approach to statistical analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks â€“ the tools of choice for Data Scientists and Data Analysts. 

After completing this course, a learner will be able to:
- Calculate and apply measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion to grouped and ungrouped data.
- Summarize, present, and visualize data in a way that is clear, concise, and provides a practical insight for non-statisticians needing the results.
- Identify appropriate hypothesis tests to use for common data sets.
- Conduct hypothesis tests, correlation tests, and regression analysis.
- Demonstrate proficiency in statistical analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
